### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

Lab 7, part 2, was my favorite lab because I finally learned how to play blackjack and understand how the game runs and functions. I could write different tasks for which card type was in the deck. Furthermore, I learn how to not overthink my solutions and make the the code more simple. 

* lab 1 

Lab 1 was my favorite lab because I learned how to write in C++. I understood the C++ style guide and how to save my files correctly. In addition, I learned how to write statements. This lab was also very simple in which I wrote my "Hello world" code for the first time. 

* lab 2 

Lab 2, part 1, was my favorite because I could understand how to code math problems as it was fun. Also, I learned how to int functions and correct cout out statements. The style guide for the math portion was a bit hard for me in the beginning.
